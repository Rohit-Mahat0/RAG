Branch\\nfollows the below steps to ensure they don’t slip from the floor rate even by\\n0.01%\\n\\nHow did they\\nexecute it?\\n\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMind-set\\nchange- This is one of the initial steps branch took last year. \\xa0Increasing rate, competition and the\\nimportance of IRR in our business was communicated and reiterated in every\\nmeeting. Prepared the team to sell products at higher rate of interest to\\nmaintain “P” of the branch\\n\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nUnit-wise\\ntracking: Branch always quote slightly higher rate to deserving customers\\nand conclude the deal so that even if they negotiate branch can reduce a bit\\nand offer above the floor rate comfortably. Branch takes this approach for all\\npossible cases to maintain good IRR for all asset classes. Even if they do at\\nfloor rate for few customers, its compensated by doing more cases at higher IRR\\nusing the above technique\\n\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTatkal\\nrate: The Tatkal benefit offered is very rarely used as the branch tries to\\nconvince every customer for the best rate that is best decided based on his\\nprofile\\n\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nRetail\\nCustomers: Branch’s main focus is retail- SCV/LCV and ICV. Retail customers\\nare keen on getting the loan sanctioned than the interest rate. Branch takes a\\ncautious call while taking such decisions\\n\\n5.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDaily\\nTracking: This is the first thing the branch team does every morning. The\\nfirst mail they open in the morning is the branch IRR auto mail from HO. If\\nthey notice they are falling short on IRR in any asset class, they would\\nimmediately focus on the proposals in hand and make sure to increase it\\nimmediately. Daily tracking has been helping the branch to maintain these\\nlevels consistently in all asset classes\\n\\n6.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Turnaround time: \\xa0Lead inflow is high typically in the fourth\\nweek of every month as the dealers also offer discounts to attract customers.\\nSo SCV/LCV buyers generally have an inclination to buy in the last week to\\navail the discount. They agree to our rate as our TAT is very low and we ensure\\nthey get vehicle on time\\n\\n7.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Negotiation: Branch team is trained on\\nexplaining to customers on why the rate is high.

That belief in us made us more responsible.Wherever the repo vehicles are released on updation are informed of repo\\nagain even if one EMI slips.

            "The significant individual in a bank, as inferred from the provided context, appears to be the field staff. This deduction is made considering several roles mentioned across different documents. The field staff is tasked with multiple responsibilities including following up with customers, particularly those facing issues with other financiers or dealing with problems related to their funds being adjusted against other accounts. Moreover, they play a pivotal role in convincing certain customers (classified under 'B category') to settle the bank's dues before using their deposited money for adjusting gold loans. Their duties extend beyond just customer service; they are instrumental in building relationships with customers and even considered as part of the family due to their close interaction with the customers.
