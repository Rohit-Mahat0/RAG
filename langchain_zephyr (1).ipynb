Paste t he URL of \\nthe image here to fetch that particular image \\nfrom its source  \\nRange  Rating  Range property is for obtaining user rating  in \\nnumbers  \\nValue  Seekbar  This property is for extending the drag -gable \\nthumb/ Seekbar  to a given value  \\nMin and Max  Seekbar  Minimum and Maximum extension of Seekbar  \\ncan be provided using this attrib ute \\nStep  Seekbar  To set the Seekbar  interval, use this prop erty \\nResult Label  Seekbar  This is to assign a label for the Seekbar  \\nRows  CheckboxGrid and \\nRadioGrid  This property is for framing the questions in \\ncheckbox and radiobox grids  \\nColumns  CheckboxGri d and \\nRadioGrid  This is for providin g the answers/options fo r \\nthe se lected questions defined in checkbox \\nand radiobox grid controls  \\n \\n  \\nExample:  \\nLet us create forms for the EnCap Book Store  using the controls provided in the palette. \\nFor example, the Regi stration Form  for registering the new customers can be creat ed with the text and typed controls as shown below:  \\n \\nAnother form called Books Category  can also be created to allow the users to browse \\nthe books by genre. Below shown is the Books Category fo rm created by drag ging and \\ndropping the Section  and Selection  controls.  \\n \\n  \\nSet Values in For m Fields  \\nYou can easily reuse the form fields value from one form to another form by giving  the \\nname of the data key within double curly brackets {{Data key name}}. For an instance \\nlet\\'s take the  form called Payment Mode  from Book Store EnCap. This form e nables the \\nuser to select the mode of payment like Credit Card or Debit Card.   \\nThe radio control field name Payment Mode  can be reused in other form called Pay \\nthrough Credit Card . \\n \\nA new section control is added and its label is set as the field value from Payment Mo de \\nform.  \\nOutput:  \\nWhe n you click credit card option, the corresponding option wil l be displayed as the \\nlabel for the Payment through credit card  form in the EnCap laun ch.  \\nAfter creating the forms, you have to create Buttons  for using them in EnCap  forms \\nsince buttons are required to change the action of the forms when they are clicked.  \\n  Create Butto ns  \\nOverview  \\nAre your customers are bored of typing in a sma ll window in the campaigns they \\nreceive? Twixor EnCap\\'s loaded button feature which comes built -in in the Actionable \\nInstant Messaging will enable them to choose what they want to do. For example take a \\ncase w here you are requesting payment from your custo mers for the service provided \\nby you. If you send a message regarding payment, they have t o sign in into third party \\nwebsite and make the payment. This is an indirect and time consuming process.  \\nIn order to s olve this issue to an extent, Twixor EnCaps all ows you to embed a \\nbutton in the messages you send. In the above mentioned case of request ing payments, \\nwhen your customers press this transaction enabled button \"Pay\", the device will \\nperform a l ogical operat ion related to payment as programmed within the  button inside \\na EnCap. The forms associated with the buttons will be enforced instantly.  \\n \\nConfiguring Buttons  \\nHere we\\'ll create the buttons required for the EnCap Forms.  \\nPerform the steps below t o create a lo aded and actionable button for use in forms.  \\n1. Select an EnCap to which you want to create and configure the button. For example, \\nselect  the BookStore  EnCap created by us.  \\n2. Click Buttons  tab. This will open the list of the buttons used in t he selected E nCap \\n\"Book Store\".  \\n3. Click Create New Button  to create a new button for the chosen EnCap.  \\n \\n Create a New Button  \\nCreation of a new button involves the following steps:  \\n1. After clicking the Configure Button  option, enter an identity for the button in  Name .  \\nLet us give a name for the button as Browse Book  by Genr e \\n2. Provide an unique description for the button in Identifier . \\n Warning!  The button identifier should be at least 1 to 25 characters and must start with \\nan alphabet  \\n \\n3. Select t he type of the button from  Type .  \\n \\nThe button type and its characterization available  in the current version is enlisted in the \\ntable below:  \\nButton Type  Description  \\nDefault  Button to go to the next page  API Button to make API calls  \\nForm  Button for opening Forms created in Twixo r EnCaps  \\nWeb Form  Button to open external web form  \\nLink Button to load the URL  \\nCreating different types of button involves different types of co nfigurations:  \\n \\nDefault Button  \\nThe default button type is Default . Click Default  option if you want to use Next button \\nfor navigating to the next page in the campaign fl ow. \\n \\nAPI type Button  \\nSelecting API button allows you to call an API when you click it.  \\nIf you want your button to call an API, you have to first connect the API to a data source. \\nFollow these ste ps to connect the API to Appiyo or Web hook data source.  \\nTo know the ways to hook either Appiyo or other URL, you should read our guide on \\nWeb -hook Configurations . \\nData -sources refer to any system that can provide or rece ive data required for a \\nworkflow.  \\nTo connect to an Appiyo Da ta source  \\nIf you select the Datasource Type as Appiyo , follow these steps:  \\n• The datasourc e name can be selected from Appiyo Datasource . \\n• Project Id  denotes the identification for the selected projec t where the work flow \\nfor the button (in Twixor EnCaps) is d efined in Appiyo.  \\n• Select the unique work flow id for the button under the chosen project  from \\nWorkflow  Id. \\n• Choose the action executed when the button is clicked for the selected workflow \\nfrom Proc ess Id. Note!  The button action (process) will be defined in  the Script task  within the pool.  \\nFor example if you want to use Appiyo  Datasource for B ook Store EnCap, select the \\nDatasource Type as Appiyo . The option to select the Appiyo Data source will be e nabled \\nautomatically. For Book Store EnCap, we have configur ed a webhook called \\nBookStore_Webhook1  using Appiyo.  \\n \\nForm Button Type to open EnCap Forms  \\n Select Form  to choose the forms designed using Twixor  EnCaps and enter the Id of the \\nform to be  executed in Form Id . \\n• If you want the form to be displayed w ithin the same page, enable Is Inline  \\noption.  \\n \\n Web Form Button  \\nClick Web Form  type to open an external Web Form or HTML form within the EnCap.  For example, let \\'s call an external Web Form that can be used to register a new \\ncustomer.  \\nTo do so, provide the URL to fetch the web form in Web Form URL  and Height  of the \\nweb form as given below:  \\n \\nIn this example, we\\'ve used the HTML to open the registration webform.  \\nWhen  you click this Web Form Example  button we created here, the  EnCap output will \\nlook like:   \\n4. Finally click Save to create a new button or Cancel  to demolish the button creation \\nprocess. Browse Books by Category  button  is created and displayed on the list as shown \\nbelow.   \\n5. In similar manner, create Pay and Provide Payment Details  buttons for the Book \\nStore EnCap to enable payment . \\n6. You can also edit and delete the selected but ton config uration by clicking \\n  -> \\n. \\n7. Search the buttons by entering its name in Search  field.  \\n  Design Work Flow using EnCap Designer  \\nBefore starting the topic on creating work flow for Twixor EnCaps, let us fi rst dig the \\nimportance of EnCap w ork-flows. The workflow\\'s  prime objective is to aid the \\nbusinesses in preparing and automating trade campaigns. Moreover, it allows you to \\neffortlessly design even the complicated campaigns in seconds.  \\nMake your customers to adore your campaigns. This can  be accomplished by launc hing \\nthe EnCap Designer  incorporated in Twixor EnCaps . With this feature, you can structure \\nthe campaign flow within few minutes.  \\n1.

While adding the conditions,  give the name of the control within {{}}.  \\nIn this simple example, a condition is made to display two forms namely Pay through \\nCredit Card  and Payment through Debit Card  based on the payment mode selected by \\nthe us er.  \\nWhen the user selects the Debit Card  option, a form will be displayed to o btain the \\ndebit card details from the customer. By default, if the Payment Mode  is not equal to \\nDebit Card , the execution will be jumped to the Credit C ard Branch.  \\nTemplate to say Thank you  after receiving the payment from the customers is shown \\nbelow:   \\nNext guide API Node  illustrates the steps to consume Twixor Compute  or Custom REST \\nAPIs  in your application.  \\n  API Node  \\nIn most of the applications or  services we use today, API takes the main responsibility \\nthat makes two applications to intercommunicate among themselves.  \\nIn Twixor EnCaps, there is a provision of the API node  that lets you use the third -party \\nservices in y our application.  \\nIf you need t o act upon information either using Twixor Compute  (Appiyo) or another \\nsystem  and if that system provides REST APIs  for that p articular event, you can consume \\nthe third party REST  APIs within Twixor EnCaps by employing the API Node . \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  Using Twixor Compute  \\nWhen you want to perform any computations in your campaigns using Twixor EnCaps, \\nlike performin g calculations based on t he value given by the customers in EnCap forms, \\nyou can call the Twixor Compute engine ( Appiyo ) using API Node .  \\nLet\\'s use the API Node  in the BookStore EnCap for fetching and displaying the d etails of \\nthe customer ba sed on their feedback from the Twix or\\'s BPM engine(i.e. from Appiyo ). \\nFor this, let us create and use the button Get Feedback  in Thank Y ou message template \\nto get the feedback from the customer.  \\nThen Rating  form can be used to get  the customer\\'s feedback using Seekbar . \\n \\nNow place the API Node  after the Thank You  message template as  shown below:  \\n \\nClick \\n  in the API node to configure the properties of the API node.  \\n1. Give a name for the A PI node in Node Name . This name will be used to fetch the \\nresult variable from Appiyo . 2. Select the type  of API. Choose Twixor Compute  API if you want to use the Appiyo \\ndata source.  \\n3. Choose the Appiyo data source  option.  \\nFor this  example, let\\'s use the  web hook configurat ion (Connected to  Appiyo) called API \\nNode  to connect to the Appiyo Data source. To create and configure web hook \\nconfigurations, refer Webhook Configuration  guide.  \\n4. Select the Project  created in Appiyo  and select the process associated with it.  \\nCreating Process in Appiyo  \\nTo create a process in Appiyo for fetch ing the feedback from the customers, follow the  \\nsteps below.  \\n1. Go to Appiyo.com . \\n2. Select your Zone  and choose your Project  or Process Repository . In this example, a \\nprocess repository called Process Store  is selec ted. \\nRefer Create  Process Repository  section of  the Appiyo User Guide  to get a detailed \\nview on creating a new process repository.  \\n3. Then select the required process modules from the lis t. For this examp le, select a \\nmodule called User Actions . \\nFollow the steps illustrated in Modules  topic of the Appiyo User Guide  to get an \\nassistance on creating Appiyo work flow modules.  \\n4. After the selection of the module, the work flow(s) associated with the project will be \\nrendered in a li st.  \\nCreate Workflow  section will give you a clear idea on creating a new work flow.  \\nCreate and select the User Feedback  work flow and create a pool  or process called Api \\nNode Testing .  \\nSelect Task from BPMN  Nodes palette and choose \\n  Script task option. And then write \\nthe script to get the f eedback from the customer using Twixor EnCaps.   \\nLet\\'s write a simple script for fetching and disp laying the name and phone number of \\nthe customers who are gi ving t he feedback through EnCap Forms. Input variables should \\nbe same as the field name of the EnCap form controls through which the input is \\nreceived.  \\n 5. After creating the process in Appiyo, go to Twixor EnCaps  application and choose the \\nassociated Process  and Workflow  created for the Appi yo Proje ct or Process Repository \\nin the API Node Properties . \\n \\n6. In order to display the ex ecuted result, create a message template called Feedback . \\nThe computation output  can be retrieved by giving the API  node name and ou tput \\nvariable scripted in Appiyo in the following format:  \\n{{API node name. output variable}}   \\nAfter launching the Book Store EnCaps by foll owing the steps depicted in the Launch \\nConfiguration , the result obtained from the API node is given below:   \\nIn the out put shown above, the result statement is fetched and displayed from the \\noutput  variable defined in Appiyo.  \\nTo know more about App iyo Zones  and BPMN Nodes , please refer Appiyo user guide . \\nRefer Consume Rest APIs  guide to consume thi rd-party Rest APIs from your application.  \\n  Consume  Rest APIs  \\nFor some applications, it is required to consume third -party REST APIs to retrieve certain \\ndata, get the response, a nd transfer that API  response to the end user interface.  \\nSometimes, you don\\'t  want to expose all the API data and you need only certain fields of \\nthe API response.  \\nHere we\\'ll show you the  steps to either transform the whole API response or certain \\nfields  of the API response to the resource in your application easily using Twixor E nCaps.  \\n1. Select Rest  to consume third -party Rest API in your application.  \\n2. Next, select the HTTP method  from the list of available HTTP Verbs( GET, POST , PUT, \\nand DELETE ). \\nAn API request  allows you to contact with a server in order to do some action. Th ese \\nactions are termed as HTTP methods .  \\nGET Method  used to retrieve the data. It doesn\\'t impose any other effe ct on \\nthat particular data.  \\nPOST  Send away the data to the server by means of HTML forms.  \\nPUT  Replace an existing resource or data in the ser ver \\nDELETE  Delete the data from the target resourc e specified by the request URI  \\n3. Enter  the Request URI  in the input field provided. Request URI  refers the resource \\nupon which the HTTP request is applied.  \\n4. HTTP header  fields are used to give the info rmation regarding the HTTP Request  or \\nResponse , or about the data sent in the message body.  \\nClick the Header  tab to provide the appropriate header fields for the API request. This \\nwill open a key -value editor. Give the Key and Value  for the header manuall y in this \\neditor.  \\nGenerally, there are four types o f HTTP Headers .  \\nGeneral Header:  This header can be used f or describing both the request and \\nresponse messages. Examples are Cache -Control, Transfer -Encoding, Trailer, \\nUpgrade, etc.  Server Response -Header:  This header is applicable to response messages alo ne. \\nAge, Location, Etag, Set -Cookie are some examples of S erver Response -Header.  \\nClient Request -Header:  Header fields like Accept, Accept -CharSet, Authorization, \\nCookie, etc. are for defining request messa ges. \\nEntity -Header:  These headers describe the meta -data about the object\\'s body or \\nthe resource denoted by t he HTTP Request. Some frequently used entity headers \\nare Content -Type, Content -Length, Content -Location, Content -Range, etc.  \\nProvide the header bas ed on the body of the HTTP request.  \\nInfo!  For x-www -form -urlencoded  body type, Twixor EnCaps voluntarily bind s the \\nsuitable Content -Type  header so that you don\\'t want to set it manually. The Raw header \\nis set automatically as soon as you provide the data f ormat, for example, JSON.  \\nHTTP Body Data  \\nx-www -form-urlencoded  \\nSelect the body Content Type  (x-www -form -urlencoded  or Raw ) while sending the form \\ndata as a POST  Request . \\nUse x-form -www -urlencoded  type if you want to provide simple text or \\nASCII  informatio n. You have to just type the list of keys and value s in the key -value \\neditor. Twixor EnCaps will cipher it th e right way.  \\nHere let\\'s use a dummy REST API as an example to provide form -urlencoded data to \\ncreate an employee.   \\n• Use the POST  method and give the request URL.  \\n• Select the x-www -form -urlencoded  option to send plain text data  to the  Restful \\nAPI server.  \\n•  Then, give the employee details ( name, salary, ag e) in the Key-Value editor . \\n• Click Test  to view the API resp onse for this request.  \\nBelow shown is the API response  for this POST  request. An employee data is created \\nand a unique employee id is ret urned in the response.   \\nHere you also have th e option to fill the values to th e URL Parameters , Headers , and \\nBody Parameters  used in this request.  \\n• To fill the values, enter the custom Variable Name  within double curly braces in \\nthe key -value editor as shown below.   \\n• Click Test  to dynamically f ill the values.  \\n • Then hit Send  to send these values to the configured Rest API.  \\n• You may also send away these values from EnCap Forms to the organized Rest \\nAPI. To do this, create a form Employee Details  with three t ext controls to get the \\nname, age, and salary details of an employee.  \\n \\n• Then create a new button namely Provide Employee Details  of form button type \\nto call the Employee Details form ma de by us.  \\n• After creating the fo rm and button, draft and plac e the message template before \\nthe API  Node. And , don\\'t forget to use the Provide Employee Details  buttons in \\nthe message template to call the Employee Details form.   \\n• Refer the Name of th e text controls within double curly brackets while pass ing the \\nbody parameters for the Rest API  as given below. For  example, the name given for \\nthe Salary text box is Salary.   \\n• We can then fetch and display the emp loyee data created using the values given \\nin the EnCap forms by employing another message template. Note that this \\nmessage template will be pla ced next to the API  node.  \\n • In the message tem plate shown above, use the fo rmat illustrated in Fetching and \\nDisplaying the fields of API Response  section to retrieve and present the \\nemployee data.  \\nGive the employee data in the EnCap Form as shown below:  \\n \\nThis employee data will be created and  stored in the configured REST API serve r as \\nshown below.  \\n \\nRaw  \\nThe Raw  input contains almost any type of data like Plain Text , JSON , Javascrip t, XML , \\nand HTML .  \\nLet\\'s update the details of an employee c reated by us using PUT method (By giving raw \\nJSON  input). • Select PUT method and enter the Request URL .  \\n• Give the Raw  JSON data in the input editor to update the details of the employee.  \\n \\nREST  API Request and Response Example:  \\nRest API Requ est: \\nFor illustration, let us make a call to a Weather API t o fetch and display the weather \\nforecast from API  Response. For this purpose, create an EnCap called Weather Forecast \\nAPI. Then dr ag and drop an API Node  from the palette in EnCap Designer . \\n \\nThen, configure the Rest API  properties as given  below:  \\n• Give a name for the API node in Node Name . Let\\'s giv e the API Node name as \\nREST API.  \\n• Select Rest  option to access the Rest Res ources.  \\n• Select an HTTP method  to perform the desired action on an acknowledged \\nresource. In this example, choose the Get Method to retrieve the weather data.  • Type the unique identifi er of the resource (URL)  upon which the request is \\napplied. Here provide t he URL  for fetching the weather data from Weather API.  \\n \\n• Click OK to save the data.  \\n• Click Test  to test the rest API and view the response.  \\nRest API  Response:  \\nAfter hi tting the Test  button, you\\'ll be able to view the API respon se for the request  \\ngiven.   \\n \\nFetching and Di splaying the fields of API Response  \\nYou can display the data fetched from the API response in your EnCap message to the \\nend user as shown below.  \\n{{API  Node Name.res.Field Name to be fetched from the API  response}}  is the  tag for \\nfetching the Response data  from the Rest API server.  \\nIn this Weather API example, let\\'s fetch and display the humidity  data from the API \\nresponse given above. For this, create a message template by dragging the Message  \\nnode to display the humidity  data.   \\n \\nBelow shown is the output  of the weather forecast AP I launch.   \\n   Widgets  \\nWidgets act as a miniature application that provides/gets the inf ormation to/from the \\nuser respectively. This user input can also be used in the subsequent steps of EnCap \\nWorkflow.  \\nTypical widgets that you may use in Twixor EnCaps are Geolocation ,Cards , and Rich \\nCards .  \\nGeo Location Widge t \\nThis widget is used to track the user\\'s current geographical location on a map. This \\nlocation information can then be used to  \\n• Find the user\\'s nearest physical location in order to enhance the us er\\'s \\nexperience.  \\n• Shape the information according to their lo cation. For example, you can suggest \\nthe exciting offers in the nearby stores based on their location.  \\nFor example, let us create an EnCap called \" Geolocation Widget \" to explore about \\nGeolocation  widgets.  \\n• Drag and Drop  the Widgets node  from the palette.  \\n \\n• Click \\n  in Widget  node to create a new W idget message.  \\n• Configure the widget properties as given below:   \\n• Give a u nique Identifier  and enter the Message  to ask the user to select their \\ncurrent loc ation.  \\n• Select the Widget Type  as GeoLocation  if you want to use location tracking \\n(GeoLocation) widget.  \\n• Click Save  to save the created geolocation widget.  \\n• You can also fetch and display the address , latitude , and longitude  information of \\nthe user\\'s current  location in a messag e by creating a message template as sho wn \\nbelow:   \\nThe default parameter to extract the Address , latitude , and longitude  data is address , \\nlat, lng respectively. Fo r fetching the address, the format  is {{Geolocation widget \\nid.address}} . This for mat applies for both the latitude and longitude parameters.  Outpu t: \\n \\nCards  \\nWant to use a wide range of content and responsive images i n your EnCap? For this \\npurpose, Twixor EnCaps offers you an elegant container called Card Widget . The Car ds \\ncan be used to grant your customers with an exact set of information that gui des them \\nto their next best experience on your EnCap.  \\nBased on the nee d of your target audience, you can engage your customers by designing \\nthe EnCap message with horizontally  scrollable carousel.  \\nTo use Cards widget  in your EnCap, follow these steps:  \\n• Create an EnCap called Cards Widget . \\n• Begin the flow with the Start  node.  \\n•  Then, drag and drop the Widgets node  from the palette.  • Click  \\n  in Widget  node to create a new message relate d to Cards . \\n• Configu re the  Card Widget Properties  as given b elow:  \\n• Enter an Identifier  and type the Message  to describe the card.  \\n• Select the Widget Type  as Cards . \\n \\nThe card s may contain multiple images and each Image can have Image URL , Value , \\nDescription , and Footer .  \\nThese parameters can be either static one or dynamically ref erred from a variable.  \\n \\nConfigure Cards using Static Paramet ers \\nLet\\'s create a card for an example by providing its parameters directly in the appropriate \\nfields.  \\n1. Select  an Url for an image by clicking on the default image. After selecting an image, \\nits URL will be automatically placed in the Image Url  field.   \\n2. Enter the Value  which is the short lead to the additional content in c ard. \\n3. Give a longer Description  for the a ctionable images placed on th e card.  \\n4. You can also give the rich text  description for the cards. Click +Add  button to ad d a \\nnew card that will be displayed in the horizontally scro llable carousel as shown below:   \\nBelow shown are the cards with rich text  formatt ing styles. In this example, we\\'ve \\napplied the bold and Italic formatting and provided the hyperlink to the card \\ndescription.   \\n4. Then include an optional footer  within the card.  \\nCreate Cards using Dynamic Variables from Appiyo  \\nLet we also use the external variables defined in Appiyo in our card w idget created in \\nTwixor EnCaps. In order to refer the variab les dynamically from Appiyo, first, define the \\nvariables in Appiyo. The card parameters like ImageUrl, Value, Description, and Footer \\ncan also be referred dynamically from an external variab le. Defining Variables in Appiyo  \\nSteps given below shows you the w ay to define the variables in Appiyo.  \\n1. Go to Appiyo.com  and Sign In  using your Appiyo credentials.  \\n2. Create a pool called Card Widget  under Widget Workflow  in Appiyo by following the \\nsteps ill ustrated in the Creating Process  section of API Node  guide.  \\n3. Then create and define the variables for using them in card widget.  \\n4. Select the Card Widget  pool and click Add Va riable  to add the associated variable.  \\n5. Add the variables for the Card paramete rs by using the steps described in the \\nVariables  section of the Appiyo User Guide .  \\nThe variables added in  the Card Widget is given below.  \\n \\n6. Then write a script to give the values for these parameters as given belo w: \\n \\n7. Cl ick Save  and Deploy  to save and deploy the workflow successfully.  8. These variables can th en be accessed within the card widgets.  \\nUsing Appiyo Defined  Variables in Card  \\nYou can dynamically ca ll and use the variables (imageUrl, name, description, footer) \\ndefined in Appiyo in the card widget as shown below:  \\n \\nThe card in the output launch be like:  \\n \\nNext feature Message Preview  allows you to view the messages you have created in \\nmessage templates.   \\nRender Multiple Cards at R un-time  \\nMultiple cards can be rendered at run -time using the array variable.  \\nDefine an array variable called CardArray  and assign them the values in a script  task \\nwithin Appiyo as you can see below:  \\n \\nRemember to place the API node before the card widget. Then call the work -flow (In \\nthis example, Sample) and process (CardWidget) associated with this card widget using \\nTwixor Compute  option.  \\nBelow diagra m shows the prope rties of the card widget that can be used to render the \\narray variable.   \\nAnd other variables imageUrl , value , description , and footer  are given within double \\ncurly brackets  in order to fetch the associated values assigned in Appiyo.  \\nYou can also notify  the users ab out the cards selected by them. To do so, place  a \\nmessage templa te after the card widget.   \\nLaunch this EnCap so that you will be able to view multiple cards rendered at run -time.   \\n Rich Cards  \\nNowadays most of the users are demandi ng visually appealing images rather than a \\nplain text while searching f or any content. That\\'s why we have incorporated the Rich \\nCards feature to enhance the user experience without trans -coding yo ur message.   Let\\'s take an example of the Airline use case a nd create a rich card for Acme Airlines.  \\n• To begin with, let\\' create a new EnCap called Rich Card  and an inline form called \\nInfo to get the boarding details of the customer. To create a form, refer  to Create \\nand Delete Form s in EnCaps  guide.  \\n \\n• Then create a bu tton  called info to call the info form created in the previous step.  \\n \\n• After creating the form and button, drag and drop the Message  node and create a \\nmessage template to welcom e the customer. To create a new message template, \\nrefer to the Creating Message Templates for EnCap  guide.   \\n• Drag and drop the Widgets  node and select the Widget type as Rich Card .  \\n• Give the Height  and Width  of the rich card in pixels.  \\n• Place the HTML content that will be converted to image (with embedded QR \\nCode) and sent to PWA.   \\n• Click Save  to save the rich card. When this EnCap is launched using the steps given \\nin the Launch Configuration  guide, the output of the rich card will be:     Message  Preview  \\nYou can view the way your message gets displayed in Message Preview  section. \\nMessage Previ ew section will be available on the right side of the EnCap Designer  page.  \\nFor example, click the Welcome message template to preview  it on the right side.  \\n \\nMinimap lets you orient yourselves within the entire work flow.  \\n  Minimap  \\nMinimap is to give a miniature overview of the entire EnCap workflow. The entire \\nworkf low will be reflected in Minimap as shown below:  \\n \\nPoint to any par t of the minima p to view the selected region in the main workflow.  \\nView an overview of the message templates from Message Properties . \\n  Message Properties  \\nProperties section reflects the Name  and Description  properties of the EnCap. By \\ndefault, Name  field will be the name of the EnCap given durin g its creation. You can \\nalter the Name and  Description for the EnCap here.  \\n \\n  Final EnCap WorkFlow  \\nAfter connecting all the nodes in the workflow by an arrow, the final w orkflow of the \\nBook Store look like this:  \\n \\nAfter designing the workflow for the EnCaps, launch the EnCaps by following the steps \\nillustrated in Launch Configuration  guide.  \\n  Toolbar \\n A Toolbar for navigating to Forms, Web Hooks, and Buttons is also added to  the EnCap \\nflow builder.

In our example, let’s create two variables namely requestDetail  and mobileNumber  \\nof type text.  \\n  \\nMinimap  \\n Minimap located on the right pane of the communication flow designer gives a tiny \\nsnapshot of the entire comm unication flow.  \\n \\nProperties  \\nYou can define the  Flow  and Node  properties here.  \\n• Click Flow  to change a name and give a brief description of the WorkFlow. You can \\nalso give a timeout period and timeout message for the entire workflow here.  \\n• Enter a name for th e Node  by selecting the node an d clicking the Node  option.  \\nDesign the Flow  \\nNow, let us start to design flo w for the Check Account Balance  Journey.  \\nStep 1:  To initiate the flow, drag and drop the start node  from the palette.  \\nStep 2:  Drag and drop a message node \\n  and click \\n to cr eate an outgoing message.  \\nYou can share the image/ audio/ document/ location to the customers in WhatsApp to \\noffer a more engaging experience to your customers.  Pursue the steps below to send the Text/Image/Video /Audio/Document/Location to the \\ncustomers.  \\nStep 2a: Create a  plain te xt message  \\n• Click the Text  tab and enter the plain text message.  \\nIn our example, we\\'ve given the text message to welcome the customer as:  \\nWelcome to Acme Bank\\'s Account balance check modu le. \\nSend Y -> I authorize ACME Bank to use my Aadhaar number and fetch  \\ndata from UIDAI for verification to show account balance.  \\nSend N -> Request a callback. You can also connect with us at 1800 \\n1200 1200 or customercare@acmebank.in  \\n \\n• Click Save and publish this jour ney.  \\nAfter publis hing the WhatsApp journey by following the steps in Publish \\nthe WhatsApp Journey  guide, the message will be displayed as shown below:   \\nStep 2b: Embed an image in the message  \\n• Select Image tab and  enter the image source URL to fetch the image from \\nthe web.  \\n•  Give a caption for the image and click Save.  \\nAfter publishing the WhatsApp journey, the journey outpu t will look like:   \\nStep 2c: Embed a video in the mes sage  \\n• Select Video  tab and enter the video source URL to fetch the video from th e \\nweb.  \\n•  Give a caption for the video and click Save .  \\nStep 2d : Send an audio file  \\n• Click Audio  tab and enter the source URL  for the audio fil e.  \\n• Enter a caption/title  to the audio and hit Save . \\nIf this journey is published, the audio file can be viewed and downloaded by \\nthe customer as shown below.   \\n Step 2e: Send a document  \\n• Click Document  tab and enter the source URL  for the documen t.  \\n• Enter a caption/ title to the document and click Save .  \\nStep 2f: Share a location using Google Maps  \\n• Click the Location  tab and enter the source URL for the document.  \\n• Enter the latitude  and longitude  details o f the location.   \\n• Type the name and address of the locat ion to be shared.  \\nAfter publishing the journey with the location message, the output will \\nlook like:   \\nStep 2g: Send an Interactive Messages  \\nFor Button:  \\n• Select the Action type as Button  \\n• Choose the Header file type from the drop down.  \\n• Add the title in header text to use as a header.  \\n• Enter the body and footer text for the message to be displaye d. \\n• Add the Button Id and ti tle. In our example, let’s create three buttons \\nnamely Men, Women and Kids.  \\n• Click Save  button to add the button.   \\nAfter publishing the journey with the interactive message with button type, the \\noutput  will look like:   \\nFor List:  \\n• Select th e Action type as  List  \\n• By default, the He ader file type will be selected as Text . \\n• Add the title in he ader text to use as a header.  \\n• Enter the body and footer text for the message to be displayed.  \\n• Add the label for the button. In our example, let’s create a  button namely \\nShop Here . \\n• Click Add butto n to add the sections under the button.  \\n• Lets create the firs t section title as Apparels. Click \\n  icon  to add the \\nnumber of list it ems under apparels like Mens, Womens and Kids.  \\n•  Click Save  button.   \\nAfter publishing the journey with the interactive message with list type, the \\noutput will look like:   \\nStep 3:  Select the Response Type .  \\nUser  - Choose th is option to get the response from the user. If you select \\nthis type, you\\'ll be asked to map the associated variable. In this example, \\nmap the requestDetail variable.  \\nNone  - Select this type if none of the response is required for the message.  \\nSystem  - System to obtain the back -end response. Enter the timeout period \\n(in seco nds) to wait for the respon se from the system. And, enter the \\nTimeout error message  if the response is timed out.  In our example, select the response type as User  since we get Yes(Y)  or \\nNo(N) input from the user.  \\nStep 4:  Then choose the variable that shoul d be mapped with the user r esponse \\n(Y or N). Map the requestDetail  variable here.  \\nStep 5: Enter the Type Mismatch error message.   Step 6:  Choose the suit able Validator  (Max. no of characters , Min. no of characters , or \\nPattern ) that receives the input text from the user, verifies it against the selected \\nvalidator, and returns an error message if it doesn\\'t meet the  given validation criteria.  \\nStep 7:  Click the respective validator to configure it s properties.  \\n• Max. no of characters  - Give the maximum number of characters allowed in the \\nuser input in Value . Type the Error Message that should be displayed when the \\ntext exceeds the specified number of characters.  \\n• Min. no of characters  - Enter the Valu e to validate the minimum number of \\ncharacters in the input.  \\n• Pattern  - Three types of pattern validation are a vailable here.  \\nEmail:  Can be used while obtaining the email id  from the user.  \\nURL:  Used to check the valid URL.  \\nPattern:  This validation is used to check the value of the <input> element \\nagainst the specified regular expression.  \\nIf you select this pattern, you have to provide a validation Expression .  \\nFor example, g ive the expression  as [A-Z]{5}[0 -9]{4}[A -Z]{1}  for verifying \\nthe PAN  card details.  \\nStep 8:  If the user input is invalid, you can ask the user to re -enter the text the \\nmaximum number of times given  in Maximum no of retries . An error message  should \\nbe displa yed if the retry count exceeds the given limit .  \\nStep 9:  Enter the message timeout period in seconds and the timeout message. After \\ncreating a message, the flow will lo ok like this:   \\nStep 10:  Then add a delay node in the comm unication flow using a Delay  node. Drag \\nand drop the dela y node and enter the delay (in seconds) and click OK to add a delay \\nbetween two nodes. Here, the delay node is added be tween welcome image and \\nwelcome message to pause the execution for 5 seconds.  \\nThe Delay Node has only one configurable value; the number of seconds for which the \\nnext running workflow should be paused. The number of seconds can be anything from \\n0 (no pause ) to 30 seconds. Because a workflow\\'s maximum execution time is limited to \\n30 se conds, no pauses longer than 30 seconds are permitted.  \\n Step 11:  Add a another flow in the same journey using a Call Activity  node. A Call \\nActivity element calls another  process referring to a process definition that is previously \\ndefined and is available for reuse but restricted  only inside the project. The  main \\nexecution waits until the called process is completed,  and then the original process will \\ncontinue.  \\nDrag and d rop the call activity node and choose the target process under Call Activity \\nProperties.  \\nMap the target process ’s variables with the respect ive variables defined inside call \\nactivity under Variable Ma pping and click OK. \\n \\nStep 12:  Add the Chat  node to pass the client query to the agent.  \\nIn message node, enter the message to b e displayed and map the variable to get the \\nquery like tw_query. Then, Drag and drop the Chat  node and enter the va riable starting \\nwith $ and within the curly braces like ${tw _query} in Message  to pass the query \\nmessage to the agent.  \\nEnter the agent/ depar tment name in Service , so that the particular chat will be sent to \\nthe corresponding agent.   \\nStep 13:  Then make a decision in the communication flow using a Decision  node \\n . \\nDrag and drop the decision node and add the required conditions.  \\n• To add a conditiona l branch statement, click Add B ranch . \\n• Key in a unique branch label for the condition.  \\nInfo!  The label can be used to track the condition in the flow  \\n• And enter the condition starting with $ and within the curly braces like \\n${requestDetail.toLowerCase() == \"y\"}. It is used to tell that t he na me following \\nthe sigil symbol $ is a variable name and not a constant or a keyword.  \\nInfo!  If any of the above conditions are not met, execution will jump to this \\nbranch   \\nLook at the  flow after placing the decision node.  \\n \\nAfter the decision node, keep a message node to get the mobile number from the \\ncustomer to find out the Account linked with that mobile number.   \\nStep 14:  You can also consume the third -part y Rest API  or in this conversational builder \\nusing API node  . Let\\'s use the rest API  node here to call the Account API  for fetching the \\nAccount Balan ce of the customer if he enters t he Yes keyword.  \\n• Drag and Drop the API Node . \\n• Then configure t he API  properties using the steps illustrated in the API Node  \\nguide. For calling the REST APIs within your communication flow, ref er Consume \\nRest APIs  topic.  \\n• Add a variable to fe tch the API  resp onse field. Here a variable called \\naccountBalance  is added to obtain the API  response value. Note that the reserved \\nkeyword _temp.res  must be used before the API r esponse field name.   \\n• Then place a message node under Call Account API  t$o display the Acco unt \\nBalance that is fetched from the API  response.  \\n \\n• Add another node to display a Thank You  message when  the user enters No \\nkeyword(the flow will jump to this Default branch).   \\nStep 14:  Then finall y add the end node  to terminate the process.  \\nStep 15:  The top menu of the designer page contains three options:  \\n \\nVerify:  To test the workflow for any errors.  \\nGo Back:  For navigating t o the previous page.  \\nSave:  To save the communication workflo w. \\n  Append a Rich Card in Twixor WhatsApp Journey  \\nRich cards are a new str uctured markup to display content in an even more engaging \\nand visual format, with a focus on providing a better mobile u ser experience. Based on \\nthe input from the end -user, the fi nal result to be displayed on the rich card is the \\ndynamic inputs from the user.  \\n Let us take a look at how the rich card can be embedded in the WhatsApp Journey.  \\nA Rich card is implemented usin g an API Call activity .  \\n \\nAfter calling  this API in the journey, there are predefined pr operties wh ich needs to be \\nadded.  \\n \\nMET HOD:  POST – Header Side  URL: \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/converter/api/co nvert?type=image&amp;options=%7B%22heig\\nht%22%3A755%2C%22widt h%22%3A453%7D   \\nKey: Content -Type  \\nValue : text/plain  \\nBody Side:  \\n \\nThe designed Rich card will be conve rted to a HTML file and this that content will be \\ncopied to the raw data under the body.  \\nA new variable to be created in th e Journey. (Ex: rich cards).  \\nFinally, under the variable map ping, the variable which was created to be called and the \\nvalue ${temp.re s.filePath}  to be called out.  \\nLast step is to add a message node and print the variable under the image tab which \\nwas creat ed.  \\nThe outcome of the rich card cre ation is:  \\n Dimen sions:  \\nThe rich card during the impleme ntation, needs to be given the width and length so that \\nthe outcome exactly displays the full designed rich card. The minimum dimension \\nneeded for a rich card would be 800*800 width and length. However, these dimensio ns \\nare not fixed and would vary based o n the rich cards. It would be appropriate to reach \\nout to th e rich card designer for the exact dimensions.  \\n  AI Node  \\nWhatsApp Chatbot runs on the WhatsApp platform. Once the chatbot window presents \\nitself, the user ca n enter  their reply in plain English. T he bots will respond to the reply \\nwhen it receives as normal  WhatsApp messages and respond to them.  \\nFor example, for selecting the preferred language 1 for English and 2 for Arabic, client \\ncan send either 1 or 2. Sup pose if  a client enters the message as a plain text (English or \\nArabic), the corresponding flow sho uld be continued. This can be achieved by using AI \\nnode.  \\nSample flow for selecting the gender  \\n1. Create a flow in the journey  \\n2. Add a new variable for selecting the gender  \\n3. In message node, enter the m essage as select your gender 1. Male 2. Female. \\nSelect the r esponse type as “User” and map the variable you have created.  \\n4. Then, drag and drop the decision node to add the conditions.  \\n5. Add the message for each condition  \\n6.

AIM extends the user interface of the \\nente rprise application to the IM window and allows two way user interaction. It ha s the \\ncapabilities like Loaded But tons, Dynamic Form shipping and Configurable work flows.  \\nHow Twixor EnCaps differ from other messengers?  \\nTwixor EnCaps is not a P2P (people to p eople) messenger or a collaboration tool. It is \\nprimarily a A2P (Application t o People) and P2A (People to Appli cation) two way user \\ninteraction solution. The consumption models and pricing models are very flexible and \\nhence can be customized to suit each requirement.  \\nIs Twixor EnCaps only available on the cloud?  \\nNo. White labeled o n premise implementations are also  offered.  \\nHow to use Twixor EnCaps?  \\nThe front end of Twixor EnCaps is available as a stand -alone mobile app that can be \\nintegrated with your exi sting IT system. It is also available as a widget that can b e \\nembedded in your  existing mobile app. Twixor EnCap s back end can be hosted either \\non-premise or on the Cloud, and then integrated with your existing back end system.  \\nHow long it will consume to integrate the AIM capability to my IT Application?  \\nTwixor En Caps can be embedded or integrated within 2 -3 days. More complex \\nimplementations may take up to a week or 10 days.  \\nWill you offer Implementation and Support?  \\nYes, For end user customers / enterpri ses, Appiyo offers complete integration, \\nimplementation and support services either directly or through its chan nel partners. \\nISV’s who want to bring AIM capability to their existing / new products, can license the \\nproduct and make use of our product suppo rt services.  \\nWhat are the possible use cases of Twixor EnCap s? \\nTwixor EnCaps can be incorporated in to any enter prise application across verticals and \\nindustries (example Hospital Management System, BFSI Application, HRMS, CRM, \\nMarketing Campaign Managemen t etc). Compared to other forms of user interaction such as Mobile Apps and Web Forms, AIM increases the immedia cy, user \\nresponsiveness and engagement.  \\nWhy is an auto -generated value getting captured in some fields when a report is \\ngenerated?  \\nFor eg: if th e original link is \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/pwa/campaign?eId=1536&amp;campaignId=616f9367d12c7bc0\\nd78d8072&amp;phoneNumber=978980564 7, this is the unique link for this number, to \\nmake it comm on link remove the phoneNumber=9789805647 and add gl i=true and the \\ngeneric link becomes \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/pwa/campaign?eId=1536&amp;campai gnId=616f9367d12c7bc0\\nd78d8072&amp;gli=true   \\nCan we create flow for a campaign in more than one language?  \\nYes, we can have two or more languages within the same flow.  \\nWhy we are receiving duplica te chats and messages from a single customer?  \\nDuplicate entr ies occur when a chat is kept open and the same user  begins another chat \\nwith the same number.

Introduction to API Documentation  \\nTwixo r EnCaps is a developer -friendly enterprise instant messaging platform, which \\nsupports a rich set of REST APIs to access all ava ilable features from external \\napplications. One can generat e EnCap launch URL and send these EnCap launches using \\nthese APIs. Th ese APIs are simple to understand and secure to use and are accessible on \\nthe cloud once the enterprise registration process is complete.  \\nEnterprise systems can call Twixor EnCaps APIs to  send messages to mobile devices as \\nwell as Twixor EnCaps can access enterprise systems through Appiyo  workflows. Twixor \\nEnCaps APIs can be used in apps. In o rder to interact with Twixor EnCaps platform and \\nexecute yo ur business requirements, you may consume the powerful, simple REST A PIs \\nthat we provide.  Getting Started with Tw ixor EnCaps REST APIs  \\nIn order to interact with aim.twixor.com  you may consume the powerful and simple \\nREST APIs that Twixor EnCaps provides. Each Twixor EnC aps REST resourc e has a specific \\nURI name as its identificat ion. Twixor EnCaps REST APIs access these resources via their \\nURI by using standard HTTP methods ( POST, PUT, GET  and DELETE ). The response \\nformat is JSON.  \\nIt is easy to integrate and use. You can use any developm ent environment/langu age to \\naccess the REST APIs as they are based on open standards.  \\nAbout this document  \\nThis document guides you to use Twixor APIs. The prerequisites to use this document \\ninclude, basic familiarity with software developme nt and web servi ces. This document \\nhelps you understand: - \\n• Authentication flow  \\n• HTTP request including URI structure  \\n• JSON responses (Both Success and Failure responses)  \\n• Description of the request and response parameters  \\nUnderstanding Twixor EnCaps RE ST Resources  \\nTable given below displa ys the types of HTTP me thods that provides access to the \\nREST  resources.  \\nMethod  Description  \\nGET Retrieves and displays information about requested resource  \\nPOST  Creates new resources  \\nPUT Updates specific resource for  a given id  \\nDELETE Deletes resources for given id  \\n URI Structure of Resources  \\nGeneral URI form of all the resources:  \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/e/enterprise/< resource >/ \\nresource  Name of the requested resource  \\nExample:   \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/e/enterprise/cam paigns/  \\nBased o n the request, the general URI may have one or more combinations of the \\nfollowing information appended at the end.  \\nSome example URIs are:  \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/e/enterprise/<resource>/< resource id > \\nresource id  Unique id assigned for the r esource  \\nExample:   \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/e/enterprise/campai gns/54daef2174093e3d84ae3280  \\n \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/e/enterprise/<resource>? name=&agentStatus=&createdOn=&\\nperPage=32  \\nname  Name of the resource to find  \\n \\nagentStatus  Filters the resource based o n its availabili ty status  \\ncreatedOn  Filters the resource bas ed on the date it is created  \\nperPage  Sets the page limit for displaying the list of filtered resource  Example:  \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/e/enterprise/users?name=&agentSta tus=&createdOn=&perPag\\ne=32  \\n \\n \\nhttps://aim.twi xor.com/e/enterprise/<resource>/<resource id >/<action name > \\naction name  Action to be applied to the specified resource  \\nExample:  \\nhttps://aim.twixor.com/e/enterprise/campaigns/54daef2174093e3d84ae3280/send  \\n  Quick Start  \\nThe examples in this guide use Java a nd cURL to send HTTP requests to access the REST \\nresources.  \\n \\nUnderstanding the Authentication Flow  \\nTwixor EnCaps uses authentication token (generated during login with user’s id and \\npassword) as the authenti cation to protect their data from  unauthorized ac cess. Before \\nsending REST request for access ing Twixor EnCap resources, you must get the \\nauthentication token.  \\nUse your login credentials for requesting authentication token via POST method. Twixor \\nEnCaps ve rifies the given credentials and gives the genera ted authentication token in \\nthe JSON format.  This authentication token should be added to the http cookie header  \\nin all subsequent requests  for accessing Twixor EnCap resources. During each login, a \\nnew auth entication token is generated.  \\nFollowing diagram explains the authentication flow in Twixor E nCaps:   \\nStep One: Getting Authentication Token  \\nYou can use the Login REST API to login to your Twixor EnCaps account using your \\nauthentication credentials (user id and password). An aut hentication token (in JSON \\nformat) is created which is required for fu rther access of the resources. The request \\nforma t for login is:- \\nRequest URL:  https://aim.twixor.com/account/enterprise/login  \\nRequest Method: POST  \\nResponse Content Type: \" application/jso n\" \\nExample cURL Request for getting authentication token  \\ncurl https:// aim.twixor.com/account/enterprise/login -d \"emai l=email\" -d \\n\"password=password\" -c <cookie>  Example Java Code for getting authentication token  \\n//Request for getting the authentication to ken \\nURL loginUrl =  new URL(\"https://aim.twixor.com/account/ enterprise /login \"); \\nHashMap<String, String> params = new HashMap<Strin g,String>();  \\nparams.put( \"email\",\"email\" ); \\nparams.put( \"password\",\"password\" ); \\nStringBuilder url = new StringBuilder();  \\nif(param s != null && params.size() > 0) {  \\nfor(Map.Entry<String, String>  entry : params.entrySet()) {  \\nurl.append(entry.getKey());  \\nurl.appen d(\"=\"); \\nurl.append(URLEncoder.encode(entry.getValue()));  \\nurl.append( \"&\"); \\n} \\n} \\nString data = url.toString();  \\nHttpURLConnection authConnection = (HttpURLConnection) \\nloginUrl.openConnection();  \\nauthCo nnection.setDoOutput( true ); \\nauthConnection.setRequestMethod( \"POST\" ); \\nauthConnection.setRequestProperty( \"Accept\", \"application/json\" ); \\nDataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream( authConn ection.getOutputStream ());  wr.writeBytes(data);  \\n//getting cook ie from  header fields and storing in the string “cookie”  \\n//to pass  in the subsequent requests  \\nInputStream stream = authConnection.getInputStream();  \\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader( new  InputStreamReader(stream));  \\nString response = br.readLine();  \\n  \\nJSONPars er parser = new JSONParser();  \\nJSONObject responseJson = null; \\ntry{ \\nresponseJson = (JSONObject) parser.parse(response);  \\n}catch (ParseException e){  \\nSystem.out.prin tln(\"error while parsing r esponse : \" + e.getMessage());  \\n} \\nboolean status = ( boolean ) responseJs on.get(\" status \"); \\nString cookie = \"\";  \\nif(status){  \\nJSONObject  tokenResponse = (JSONObject) responseJson.get(\" response \"); \\ncookie = (String) tokenResponse.get(\" token \"); \\n} \\nSystem. out.println (\"Cookie = \" + cookie);  \\nwr.flush();  wr.close();  \\nauthConnection.disconn ect();  \\n} \\n} \\nThe code given below stores the authen tication t oken inside the String cookie that \\nhas been received from the login response.  \\nJSONObject tokenResponse = (JSONObject) response Json.get(\" response \"); \\nString cookie = (String) tokenResponse.get(\" toke n\"); \\nThe response to the login request is given be low:  \\nSucce ss Response  \\n{ \\n\"message\" : { \\n\"message\" : \"Login success\" , \\n\"code\" : 0 \\n}, \\n\"response\" : { \\n\"token\" : \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx\"  \\n}, \\n\"status\" : true  \\n} \\n \\nFailure Response for incorrect user credenti als \\n{ \"message\" : { \\n\"message\" : \"Login failed\" , \\n\"code\" : 1403  \\n}, \\n\"response\" : { }, \\n\"status\" : false  \\n} \\nInput Parameters  \\nTable given below shows the input parameter description for log in.  \\nemai l Email -Id used to login to Twixor EnCaps  \\npassword  Password used to login to Twixor EnCaps  \\nResponse Explanation  \\nThe response ex planation for login is given in the table below:  \\nmessage  Success or Failure message of the Request  \\ncode  Response code for the  request Example - 0 = Login Success 1403 = Login \\nfailed  \\ntoken  Genera ted authentication token  \\nstatus  True = Request has been pro cessed successfully False = Request has not \\nbeen processed  \\nStep Two: Adding Authentication Token in Subsequent Requests  \\nLet’s  see how to send POST request by adding the authentication token that we \\nreceived from the login response. To send HTTP request us ing following code, \\nreplace <Request URL>, <Input Parameter>  and <Parameter Value> with \\nappropriate data.
